# Constraints
When programming, we do not want things to be too open. We want 
potential, after all, a programming language with no potential is useless.

**However,**
*constraints breed creativity and effeciency*.

Take some problem you wish to solve with a program. The more constraints we 
have on our input, our solution space, and our ways of solving our problem,
the *easier* it will be to solve. We can make assumptions that benefit us,
we can build a system around those assumptions, and we can optimize around them.

Constraints are your friend. Apply them when you can, use them when you can.
Less is more.
